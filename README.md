#  What is Feature Engineering?

* Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that are suitable for machine learning models.
* In other words, it is the process of selecting, extracting, and transforming the most relevant features from the available data to build more accurate and efficient machine learning models.
* The success of machine learning models heavily depends on the quality of the features used to train them. Feature engineering involves a set of techniques that enable us to create new features by combining or transforming the existing ones.
* These techniques help to highlight the most important patterns and relationships in the data, which in turn helps the machine learning model to learn from the data more effectively.

# What are the Steps in Feature Engineering?
* The steps for feature engineering vary per different Ml engineers and data scientists. Some of the common steps that are involved in most machine-learning algorithms are:

# Data Cleansing
* Data cleansing (also known as data cleaning or data scrubbing) involves identifying and removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the dataset. This step is important to ensure that the data is accurate and reliable.
* Data Transformation
* Feature Extraction
* Feature Selection

* Feature selection involves selecting the most relevant features from the dataset for use in machine learning. This can include techniques like correlation analysis, mutual information, and stepwise regression.

* Feature Iteration
Feature iteration involves refining and improving the features based on the performance of the machine learning model. This can include techniques like adding new features, removing redundant features and transforming features in different ways.
